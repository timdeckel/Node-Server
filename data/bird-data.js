    textContent: "The Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migratory journey of any bird. These remarkable birds travel from their breeding grounds in the Arctic, all the way to Antarctica and back again, covering a round-trip distance of about 44,000 kilometers (27,000 miles) each year. This incredible migration allows them to experience two summers in a single year."
